# CS50x's Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to the CS50x's Introduction to Computer Science course! This course is part of the CS50x series offered by Harvard University and provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of computer science.

## About the Course

CS50x's Introduction to Computer Science is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in computer science concepts and problem-solving skills. Throughout the course, you will learn about various topics, including algorithms, data structures, memory, computer architecture, and more.

The course primarily uses the C programming language to explore these concepts. You will gain hands-on experience with C programming through lectures, problem sets, and projects. Additionally, the course incorporates programming exercises in other languages like Python to broaden your understanding of programming concepts.

## Projects

In addition to problem sets, CS50x's Introduction to Computer Science features several projects that allow you to implement more extensive solutions and demonstrate your understanding of the course material. These projects serve as milestones throughout the course and provide hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

Here are some of the notable projects you will encounter in CS50x's Introduction to Computer Science:

- [Project 0: Scratch](./CS50x/Week 0 - Scratch/project0): An introductory project that involves creating interactive stories, games, and animations using Scratch, a block-based programming language.
- [Project 1: C](./CS50x/Week 1 - C/project1): A programming project where you implement a set of programs in the C programming language, demonstrating your understanding of basic programming concepts.

These projects will challenge you to apply your programming skills, think critically, and develop efficient solutions.
