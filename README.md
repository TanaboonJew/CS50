## Course Structure

The CS50 course is divided into several lectures, problem sets, and projects. Each lecture covers a specific topic and is accompanied by problem sets that allow me to apply the concepts learned. The projects are more extensive assignments that require me to implement practical solutions using the knowledge acquired throughout the course.

## Projects

Throughout the CS50x course, I will work on various projects that demonstrate my understanding and application of the course material. These projects serve as milestones to test my skills and showcase my abilities in different areas of computer science and software development.

Here are some of the notable projects I have encounter in CS50x:
